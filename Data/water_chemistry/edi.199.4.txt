  Depth profiles of dissolved organic carbon and total and dissolved
  nitrogen and phosphorus were sampled from 2013 to 2017 in five
  drinking water reservoirs in southwestern Virginia, USA. These
  reservoirs are: Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove
  Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia), Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton,
  Virginia), Gatewood Reservoir (Pulaski, Virginia), and Spring Hollow
  Reservoir (Salem, Virginia). Beaverdam, Carvins Cove, Falling Creek,
  and Spring Hollow Reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western
  Virginia Water Authority as primary or secondary drinking water
  sources for Roanoke, Virginia, and Gatewood Reservoir is a drinking
  water source for the Town of Pulaski, Virginia. The dataset consists
  of depth profiles of water chemistry samples measured at the deepest
  site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam. Additional water chemistry
  samples were collected at a gauged weir on Falling Creek Reservoir's
  primary inflow tributary. The samples were collected approximately
  fortnightly from March-April, weekly from May-October, and monthly
  from November-February.

  SAMPLING TIMES Most sampling occurred between the hours of 9:00 and
  15:00, and are denoted in the DateTime as 12:00. Some sampling
  occurred outside of these hours, including some overnight sampling;
  these instances are noted by the actual sampling time within the
  DateTime column. For more information about nighttime sampling, see
  Doubek et. al. 2018.

          
  SAMPLE COLLECTION AND EQUIPMENT

          
  Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)

          
  Unfiltered water samples were collected at specified depths for each
  reservoir using a 4L Van Dorn water sampler (Wildco, Yulee, Florida,
  USA). Sample timestamps for samples collected between approximately 9
  a.m. and 3 p.m. were standardized to noon. Samples collected for
  projects that required sample collection at specific times of day were
  standardized to the top of the hour during which they were collected
  (i.e., a sample timestamp of 16:00 indicates a sample taken between 4
  and 5 p.m.). Samples were stored in acid-washed 125 mL polypropylene
  bottles and frozen within 12 hours. Samples were generally analyzed
  within one year of collection date.

          
  Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4) and
  dissolved organic carbon (DOC)

          
  Water samples were collected at specified depths for each reservoir
  using a Van Dorn water sampler and were filtered with a 0.7 _m glass
  fiber filter (Thomas Scientific GF/F) before being stored in
  acid-washed 125 mL polypropylene bottles. Sample timestamps for
  samples collected between approximately 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. were
  standardized to noon. Samples collected for projects that required
  sample collection at specific times of day were standardized to the
  top of the hour during which they were collected (i.e., a sample
  timestamp of 16:00 indicates a sample taken between 4 and 5 p.m.).
  Samples were frozen within 12 hours. Samples were generally analyzed
  within six months of collection date.

          
  CHEMICAL ANALYSES AND EQUIPMENT

          
  TN and TP

          
  Samples were digested with alkaline persulfate (Patton and Kryskalla
  2003) and then analyzed colorimetrically using flow injection analysis
  (APHA 2005). TN was analyzed using the cadmium reduction method (APHA
  1998) and TP was analyzed using the ascorbic acid method (Murphy and
  Riley 1962) on a Lachat Instruments XYZ Autosampler ASX 520 Series and
  QuikChem Series 8500 (Lachat ASX 520 Series, Lachat Instruments,
  Loveland, Colorado, USA).

          
  SRP, NO3, NH4

          
  Samples were analyzed colorimetrically using flow injection analysis
  (APHA 2005). SRP was analyzed using the ascorbic acid method (Murphy
  and Riley 1962), NO3 was analyzed using the cadmium reduction method
  (APHA 1998), and NH4 was analyzed using the Berthelot Reaction method
  (Solorzano 1969, APHA 2005) with a common modification as to the
  source of the hypochlorite ion as described in Zhang et al. 1997 on a
  Lachat Instruments XYZ Autosampler ASX 520 Series and QuikChem Series
  8500 (Lachat ASX 520 Series, Lachat Instruments, Loveland, Colorado,
  USA).

          
  DOC

          
  DOC was analyzed using the persulfate catalytic method (Brenton and
  Arnett 1993) on a TOCA 1010 from OI Analytical from 2013-2016 (OI
  Analytical 1010 Total Organic Carbon Analyzer with 1051 autosampler,
  College Station, TX USA) and on a Vario TOC Cube from Elementar from
  2016-2017 (vario TOC cube, Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Hanau,
  Germany).

          
  ADDITIONAL NOTES From 2013 to 2017, multiple whole-ecosystem
  manipulations were conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These
  manipulations include intermittent operation of hypolimnetic
  oxygenation and pulsed epilimnetic mixing engineering systems. For a
  detailed description of the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered
  system, see Gerling et al. (2014) and for a detailed description of
  the epilimnetic mixing engineered system, see Chen et al. (2017).
  These systems were operated over time following Table 1 in Gerling et
  al. (2016), Table 1 in Munger et al. (2016), and Table 2 in McClure et
  al. (2018).
