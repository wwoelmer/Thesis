  Depth profiles of depth, temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity,
  specific conductivity, chlorophyll a, turbidity were collected with a
  CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth) profiler fitted with a SBE
  43 Dissolved Oxygen sensor and an ECO Triplet Fluorometer and
  Backscattering Sensor from 2013 to 2017. In 2017, pH and
  oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) were also collected with a SBE 27
  pH and O.R.P. (redox) sensor. CTD profiles were collected in five
  drinking water reservoirs in southwestern Virginia, USA. All variables
  are measured every 0.25 seconds, resulting in depth profiles at
  approximately ten centimeter resolution. The five reservoirs are:
  Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir
  (Roanoke, Virginia), Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia),
  Gatewood Reservoir (Pulaski, Virginia), and Spring Hollow Reservoir
  (Salem, Virginia). Beaverdam, Carvins Cove, Falling Creek, and Spring
  Hollow Reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water
  Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke,
  Virginia, and Gatewood Reservoir is a drinking water source for the
  Town of Pulaski, Virginia. The dataset consists of CTD depth profiles
  measured at the deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam as
  well as other reservoir sites on a transect upstream in Carvins Cove
  Reservoir and Falling Creek Reservoir. The profiles were collected
  approximately fortnightly in the spring months, weekly in the summer
  and early autumn, and monthly in the late autumn and winter.

  Depth profiles of multiple water-quality variables were collected from
  2013 through 2017 using a Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTD)
  profiler from SeaBird Electronics (SBE, Bellevue Washington, USA).
  Profiles were collected, at minimum, monthly between May to October
  (usually weekly or subweekly), and bimonthly between November to
  April. Most CTD casts were collected from 9:00 to 15:00, however, some
  CTD casts were collected at night.

          
  The CTD was calibrated by the manufacturer yearly (usually in
  December-February) according to the standards and practices of SBE and
  the companies with secondary sensors coupled to the instrument.

          
  Instruments, manual, and serial numbers used between 2013 - 2017
  Multiple sensors and instruments were added over time; below we note
  changes in the CTD software, sensor versions, and provide links to the
  accompanying instrument manuals.

  From 2013 to 2017, multiple whole-ecosystem manipulations were
  conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These manipulations include
  intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation and pulsed
  epilimnetic mixing engineering systems. For a detailed description of
  the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system, see Gerling et al.
  (2014) and for a detailed description of the epilimnetic mixing
  engineered system, see Chen et al. (2017). These systems were operated
  over time following Table 1 in Gerling et al. (2016), Table 1 in
  Munger et al. (2016), and Table 2 in McClure et al. (2018).
