  Discrete depth profiles of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH were
  collected with a YSI water quality probe and discrete depth profiles
  of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were collected with a
  LI-COR underwater light meter from 2013 to 2017 in five drinking water
  reservoirs in southwestern Virginia, USA. Secchi disk depth data
  complement the PAR data to estimate water transparency. Additional
  variables measured by the YSI are conductivity and ORP (oxidation
  reduction potential or redox); all YSI and PAR depth profiles were
  collected on approximately 1-meter intervals. These reservoirs are:
  Beaverdam Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir
  (Roanoke, Virginia), Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia),
  Gatewood Reservoir (Pulaski, Virginia), and Spring Hollow Reservoir
  (Salem, Virginia). Beaverdam, Carvins Cove, Falling Creek, and Spring
  Hollow Reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water
  Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke,
  Virginia, and Gatewood Reservoir is a drinking water source for the
  Town of Pulaski, Virginia. The data package consists of two datasets:
  1) YSI and PAR profiles; 2) Secchi depth data. The YSI and PAR depth
  profiles and Secchi depths were measured at the deepest site of each
  reservoir adjacent to the dam (Site 50), as well as at a gauged weir
  on the primary inflow tributary (Site 100) at Falling Creek Reservoir
  and other in-reservoir transects in Falling Creek Reservoir (Site 45,
  30, 20, 10). The samples were collected approximately fortnightly in
  the spring months (Mar. - May), weekly in the summer and early autumn
  (Jun. - Sept.), and monthly in the late autumn and winter (Oct. -
  Feb.).

  Field sample collection

          
  At each sampling site in each reservoir, temperature, dissolved oxygen
  (DO), conductivity, pH, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) were
  collected at discrete, approximately 1 m increments from the water
  surface to the deepest portion of the reservoir using a YSI ProPlus
  with Quatro cable (pH, ORP, conductivity) or YSI ProODO optical
  dissolved oxygen meter (dissolved oxygen, temperature). Dissolved
  oxygen was calibrated approximately weekly using the water-saturated
  air technique. The pH sensor was calibrated approximately weekly using
  a series of three standardized pH solutions (pH 4, 7, 10) and the ORP
  sensor was calibrated approximately weekly using Zobell solution.,

          
  Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was collected at discrete,
  approximately 1 m increments from the water surface to the depth of
  light extinction (~ 0 micromole m-2 s-1) using a LiCor LI-192
  underwater quantum sensor. PAR was also measured in air approximately
  0.1 m above the water surface; these depths are recorded as -0.1m.

          
  Secchi disk depth was measured using a standard 20 cm diameter
  circular Secchi disk attached to a calibrated rope. Secchi depth
  measurements were made without the aid of a plexiglass viewer. The
  disk was lowered from the shaded side of the boat or dock, and the
  water depths at which the disk disappeared while being lowered and
  reappeared while being raised were averaged to determine Secchi depth.

          
  YSI and PAR profiles, and Secchi depths, were collected approximately
  fortnightly in the spring months (Mar. - May), weekly in the summer
  and early autumn (Jun. - Sept.), and monthly in the late autumn and
  winter (Oct. - Feb.). Most sampling occurred between the hours of 9:00
  and 15:00, and are denoted in the DateTime as 12:00. Some sampling
  occurred outside of these hours, including some overnight sampling;
  these instances are noted by the actual sampling time within the
  DateTime column. For more information about nighttime sampling, see
  Doubek et. al. 2018.

          
  The YSI and PAR depth profiles and Secchi depths were measured at the
  deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam (Site 50), as well
  as at a gauged weir on the primary inflow tributary (Site 100) at
  Falling Creek Reservoir and other in-reservoir transects in Falling
  Creek Reservoir (Site 45, 30, 20, 10). For a map of the transects in
  Falling Creek Reservoir, see Chen et al. 2016.

          
  From 2013 to 2017, multiple whole-ecosystem manipulations were
  conducted at Falling Creek Reservoir. These manipulations include
  intermittent operation of hypolimnetic oxygenation and pulsed
  epilimnetic mixing engineering systems. For a detailed description of
  the hypolimnetic oxygenation engineered system, see Gerling et al.
  (2014) and for a detailed description of the epilimnetic mixing
  engineered system, see Chen et al. (2017). These systems were operated
  over time following Table 1 in Gerling et al. (2016), Table 1 in
  Munger et al. (2016), and Table 2 in McClure et al. (2018).
